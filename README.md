test

A bunch of Java based coding interview questions and answers from various different companies. Summary is as follows:

- Airline
A shortest path algorithm question (Dijkstra). Program reads in a graph of nodes and the distance between them, then can return the shortest path between two nodes. Further work also includes printing out the minimum spanning tree given the graph.

- Auction
A multi-threaded bid tracking system, like a very basic version of eBay. Deals with multiple people making competing bids and printing out the winning bid using a tree to store bids.

- Fibonacci
Both iterative and recursive implementations of fibonacci 

- Games
The start of a game that will contains pegs and spaces. I can't remember where this came from...

- Hackerrank
Various different solutions to problems on hackerrank.com

- Linemanager
A program showing the power of binary search trees. It showcases two algorithms, 1) a level by level breadth first search algo through the tree, and 2) the lowest common ancestor between two nodes on a tree.

- Linkedlist
Various different algorithms for manipulating linked lists

- Pointers
How pointers work in Java

- Random
A question around weighted probabilites. Given a bunch of input numbers and their relative weight, write an algorithm that returns a random number given the weights. There are various different implementations with different complexities.

- Termcount
A question showing the power of maps when it comes to counting search terms. Also shows using a treemap for storing sorted search terms.

- Trees
Various different algorithms around trees, including depth first search and breadth first search.
